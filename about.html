					<h3>The story so far</h3>
					<p>Mike began his career in 1988 as a junior programmer at Computer Business Centres (now Sanderson Proteus), on work experience from an HND IT course at Leeds Polytechnic (now Leeds Beckett University). When the placement was up he was offered a full time job as a Progress 4GL programmer. Sadly the Poly did not allow him to complete his studies part time, but he has not looked back since.</p>
					<p>In the early 90's he left permanent employment and for the next 10 years plied his trade as a Progress 4GL/RDBMS contractor, primarily in software development and DBA roles.</p>
					<p>Around the turn of the millenium he joined forces with a friend from student days and they started Supportive, a moderately successful consultancy in Leeds offering IT solutions. Whilst at the consultancy he took on a number of roles for the first time, including Customer Support, Business Analysis and Project Management.</p>
					<p>By the mid 2000's he felt the business was not going in the direction he wanted it to, so they parted ways, and he returned to software development in permanent employment. This move paved the way for him to pick up Data Migration and advanced DBA skills.</p>
					<p>After around 4 years of this, he got itchy feet again and plunged himself back into contracting. During this time he was able to utilise my Data Migration, Project Management and even BA skills, alongside development, his roles did not lack variety!</p>
					<p>In around 2011 an old friend asked if he wanted to join his expanding company Intechnica and pick up a new skill - Performance Testing. He'd had a little experience of this on one of his contracts as a Project Manager and felt it was an increasingly important function, so he jumped at the chance, learning from one of the industry's finest Ian Molyneaux. He soon found his niche in the testing field as a Technical PM, delivering managed testing services to a variety of clients. Sadly, customer requirements change and the role was made redundant as more and more clients took performance testing in-house.</p>
					<p>He joined Qualitest in April 2015. Beginning with solo performance and automated test projects before taking on a Test Service Manager role at EE. His final year with Qualitest was spent in a strategic role with The Co-operative Group in Manchester, advising on QA Governance improvement. After seven months on furlough due to the Covid 19 pandemic, he took voluntary redundancy in October 2020.</p>
					<p>Early in 2021 Mike decided to get back into the contract/freelance marketplace and started Mboroga Horn Consulting, beginning a contract Programme Test Manager role for Edge Testing at CalMac in March.</p>
