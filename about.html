						<p>Mike is a successful IT consultant with over 30 years' industry experience.
							Over this time he has held a number of roles:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Software Developer</li>
							<li>Business Analyst</li>
							<li>Test Manager</li>
							<li>Project Manager</li>
							<li>Migration Consultant</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Having worked for many organisations over his career. Mike is passionate about sharing his experience with 
							organisations seeking to improve the quality of their software development processes. 
						Passing on valuable lessons learned in the hope that they can avoid or at least be 
						aware of them.</p>
						
						<p>We have bases in both the UK and Kenya and welcome enquiries from the UK, Europe or East Africa.</p>
					
						<h3>The story so far</h3>
						<p>Mike began his career in 1988 as a junior programmer at Computer Business Centres (now Sanderson Proteus), on work experience from an 
							HND IT course at Leeds Polytechnic (now Leeds Beckett University). When the placement was up he was offered a full time job as a Progress 4GL
							 programmer. Sadly the Poly did not allow him to complete his studies part time, but he has not looked back since.</p>
						<p>In the early 90's he left permanent employment and for the next 10 years plied his trade as a Progress 4GL/RDBMS contractor, primarily in 
							software development and DBA roles.</p>
						<p>Around the turn of the millenium he joined forces with a friend from student days and they started Supportive, a moderately successful 
							consultancy in Leeds offering IT solutions to SMEs. Whilst at the consultancy he took on a number of roles for the first time, including Customer
							 Support, Business Analysis and Project Management.</p>
						<p>By the mid 2000's he felt the business was not going in the direction he wanted it to, so they parted ways, and he returned to software 
							development in permanent employment. This move paved the way for him to pick up Data Migration and advanced DBA skills.</p>
						<p>After around 4 years of this, he got itchy feet again and plunged himself back into contracting. During this time he was able to utilise his 
							Data Migration, Project Management and even BA skills, alongside development, his roles did not lack variety!</p>
						<p>In around 2011 an old friend asked if he wanted to join his expanding consultancy Intechnica and pick up a new skill - Performance Testing. 
							He'd had a little experience of this on one of his contracts as a Project Manager and felt it was an increasingly important function, so he 
							jumped at the chance, learning from one of the industry's finest Ian Molyneaux. He soon found his niche in the testing field as a Technical PM,
							 delivering managed testing services to a variety of clients. Sadly, customer requirements change and the role was made redundant as more and 
							 more clients took performance testing in-house.</p>
						<p>He joined Qualitest in April 2015. Beginning with solo performance and automated test projects before taking on a Test Service Manager role at 
							EE. His final year with Qualitest was spent in a strategic role with The Co-operative Group in Manchester, advising on QA Governance improvement. 
							After seven months on furlough due to the Covid 19 pandemic, he took voluntary redundancy in October 2020.</p>
						<p>Early in 2021 Mike decided to get back into the contract/freelance marketplace and formed Mboroga Horn Consulting, beginning a contract Programme 
							Test Manager role for Edge Testing at CalMac in March.</p>
